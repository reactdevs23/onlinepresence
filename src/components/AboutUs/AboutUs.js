          <span className="highlight">Wiz:</span> I went from owning a
          million-follower Instagram network to building DTC brands, marketing
          agencies, and SaaS to multi 7 figures. I took all this experience and
          decided to build a personal brand on Twitter. 125,000 followers and
          multi-millions later, it was the greatest decision of my life. I've
          been able to help the top personal brands and agency owners master the
          art of becoming an authority and generating leads ORGANICALLY. And I
          am now here to help you.

          <span className="highlight">Aaron:</span> I joined X as a broke
          university student looking to make a quick buck. Soon after I learned
          that I was extremely proficient in brand building. What started as a
          small venture to clear my debt turned into a quarter million followers
          and multiple 6 figures. A broke student turned expert brand builder
          developing authority through the use of personal branding.
